### 4. Student Score Entry (Four-Step System)

The system now features a streamlined four-step process for entering student information and scores:

#### Step 1: Batch Settings
- **Class** (required): Class that will apply to all students (e.g., Form 2A)
- **Term** (required): Academic term that will apply to all students (e.g., Term 1)
- **Academic Year** (required): Academic session that will apply to all students (e.g., 2024/2025)

#### Step 2: Student Information
- **Student Name** (required): Full name of the student
- **Teacher's Comment** (optional): Teacher's remarks about the student
- **Head's Comment** (optional): Head teacher's comments

#### Step 3: Class Assessment Scores
**Assessment Options:**
- **Include Class Assessment Scores** (checkbox): Choose whether to include class assessments or use only exam scores
- **Skip Class Assessments**: Uncheck this option to use exam scores only (100% weight)

**When Class Assessments Are Enabled:**
For each course, enter the following assessment scores with **NEW WEIGHTED SCORING SYSTEM**:
- **Class Test Score**: 1-20 marks (raw score, no percentage applied)
- **Homework Score**: 1-10 marks (raw score, no percentage applied)
- **Mid-term/Mid-semester Score**: 1-100 marks (60% weighted - only this component uses percentage)
- **Class Work Score**: 1-10 marks (raw score, no percentage applied)

**Updated Score Range Rationale:**
- **Class Test**: 1-20 marks (focused classroom assessments)
- **Homework**: 1-10 marks (take-home assignments)
- **Mid-term/Mid-semester**: 1-100 marks (major examination, 60% weighted)
- **Class Work**: 1-10 marks (participation and in-class activities)

**New Calculation Formula:**
```
Class Assessment Total = Class Test + Homework + (Mid-term √ó 0.60) + Class Work
```
- **Example**: 15 + 8 + (80 √ó 0.60) + 7 = 15 + 8 + 48 + 7 = 78
- System shows both total score and weighted score in real-time
- Only Mid-term component uses percentage weighting, others use raw scores

**When Class Assessments Are Skipped:**
- System shows informational message about using exam scores only
- Exam scores will carry 100% weight for final grades
- No class assessment inputs are displayed

#### Step 4: Exam Scores
- **Exam Score**: Final examination score for each course (0-100)
- **Weight Application**:
  - **With Class Assessments**: System applies the configured exam score percentage (e.g., 70%)
  - **Without Class Assessments**: Exam scores carry 100% weight
- Shows weighted exam score calculation

**Final Grade Calculation:**
- **With Class Assessments**: Class Assessment Weighted Score + Exam Weighted Score = Final Grade
  - Example: (75 √ó 0.3) + (80 √ó 0.7) = 22.5 + 56 = 78.5
- **Without Class Assessments**: Exam Score = Final Grade (100% weight)
  - Example: 80 = 80 (no additional calculation needed)

#### Score Validation
- Scores must be between 0-100
- Student names must be unique
- All fields are required
- Class score configuration must be enabled for three-step system
